## Security Enhancements

The application has been enhanced with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to ensure data isolation and protection. Key security features include:

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all database tables
- **User Data Isolation** ensuring users can only access their own data
- **Write Protection** restricting database writes to authorized users
- **Service Role Access** for administrative functions

For more details on security implementation, see:
- `docs/DATABASE_SECURITY.md` - Complete security architecture documentation
- `supabase-security-policies.sql` - SQL for all security policies
- `scripts/test-rls-policies.js` - Script to verify security policies
- `scripts/apply-security-policies.js` - Script to apply security policies

To apply the security enhancements, run:
```bash
node scripts/apply-security-policies.js
```

To verify the security policies are working correctly, run:
```bash
node scripts/test-rls-policies.js
```
